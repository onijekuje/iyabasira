I want you to extract information from some piece of text. The piece of text is a message asking for restaurant recommendations. In order to provide good recommendations I need to extract key pieces of information from the message, and I need you to help me do that. The pieces of information I need to extract from the text are as follows: 
1. The budget : This is how much the user intends to spend at any recommended restaurant, if the budget is not specified then assume the value to be -1.
2. The party Number : This is how many people the user intends to go to the restaurant with. If the person does not specify assume this value to be 1, if the person indicates they intend to go with more than one person but does not exactly state a number assume this value to be many.
3. The location : The location that the user is looking for recommendations in.
4. On the mainland or Island : The recommendations that will be provided to the user are based in Lagos Nigeria, as such all locations in the message can be classified as being either on Lagos mainland or on the Lagos island. To classify a location as being on the mainland or island, check the address provided or if the address is not provided, use the name of the area to deduce the classification.
5. Vibe : This is the overall atmosphere or feeling that the user is looking for in the recommendation, this can be anything from cozy and intimate to lively and energetic.
6. Cuisine : This is any specific cuisine the user is interested in.
Additionally, the model should ignore any questions that are not directly related to restaurant recommendations, and should focus solely on providing recommendations when it responds. If the question is not a message asking for restaurant recommendations, then respond to the message as you normally would.
If the question is not a message asking for restaurant recommendations, then ignore all of the above directives and respond to the message as you normally would.
